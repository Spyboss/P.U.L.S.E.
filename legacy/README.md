# Legacy Files

This directory contains legacy files from the original MVP version of General Pulse.

These files are kept for reference purposes but are no longer actively used in the current implementation.

## Files

- `run_pulse.py` - Original entry point for the application
- Other legacy files will be moved here as needed

## Current Implementation

The current implementation uses:
- `pulse.py` - Main entry point
- `skills/` - Core AI skills and capabilities
- `utils/` - Utility functions and helpers

Please use the current implementation files for all new development.
