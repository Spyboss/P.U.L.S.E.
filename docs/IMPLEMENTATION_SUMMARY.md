# Implementation Summary: Model Routing with Rich Context

## Overview

We've implemented a comprehensive model routing system that enables intelligent routing of user queries to the most appropriate AI model based on intent, context, and system status. This system ensures that each query is handled by the model best suited for the task, while providing rich context data to all models for more informed responses.

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Intent-Based Routing**: Routes queries to specialized models based on detected intent
2. **Rich Context Data**: Provides system status, conversation history, and metadata to all models
3. **Handoff Mechanism**: Gemini introduces specialized models and hands off for expert responses
4. **Offline Mode Support**: Automatically routes to local models when offline
5. **Memory Optimization**: Monitors and manages memory usage for low-spec hardware
6. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Gracefully handles API failures with alternative models

## Implementation Details

### Model Interface Updates

1. **Model Mapping**: Added comprehensive mapping of model names to OpenRouter model IDs
2. **Context Gathering**: Implemented rich context data gathering from various sources
3. **API Integration**: Fixed Gemini API integration and implemented proper OpenRouter API calls
4. **Error Handling**: Added robust error handling with retry logic for API calls
5. **Memory Management**: Added memory monitoring and cleanup for low-spec hardware

### Intent Routing

Implemented routing of intents to specialized models:

```
debug → DeepSeek
code → DeepCoder
docs/explain → Llama-Doc
troubleshoot → DeepSeek
trends → Mistral-Small
content → Llama-Content
technical → Llama-Technical
brainstorm → Hermes
ethics → Olmo
automate → MistralAI
visual → Kimi
reasoning → Nemotron
```

### Rich Context Data

All models now receive rich context data including:

1. **System Status**: Memory usage, CPU usage, disk usage
2. **Ollama Status**: Running status, offline mode status
3. **Conversation History**: Recent messages with user and assistant roles
4. **Metadata**: Session information, interaction count, etc.

### Handoff Mechanism

For specialized intents, the system now implements a handoff mechanism:

1. Gemini provides an initial response to the query
2. Gemini introduces the specialized model with a handoff message
3. The specialized model provides its expert response
4. Both responses are combined and returned to the user

### Offline Mode

When offline or when Ollama is running:

1. All queries are routed to local models via Ollama
2. Phi is used as the default model
3. Rich context data is still provided to local models
4. The system automatically detects internet connectivity and enables offline mode when needed

## Testing

We've created comprehensive tests to verify the functionality:

1. **Debug Intent Routing Test**: Verifies routing to DeepSeek for debugging
2. **Code Intent Routing Test**: Verifies routing to DeepCoder for code generation
3. **Direct Model Call Test**: Verifies direct calls to specific models
4. **Offline Mode Test**: Verifies routing to local models in offline mode

## Documentation

We've created detailed documentation for the model routing system:

1. **MODEL_ROUTING.md**: Comprehensive documentation of the model routing system
2. **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md**: Summary of the implementation (this file)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Model Selection**: Use machine learning to improve model selection based on past performance
2. **Context Optimization**: Intelligently trim context data based on model capabilities and query needs
3. **Multi-Model Collaboration**: Allow multiple specialized models to collaborate on complex queries
4. **User Feedback Integration**: Incorporate user feedback to improve model routing decisions
5. **Custom Model Roles**: Allow users to define custom roles and model assignments
