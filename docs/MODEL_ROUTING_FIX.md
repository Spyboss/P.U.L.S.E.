# Model Routing Fix Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the fix for the model routing issue in P.U.L.S.E. (Prime Uminda's Learning System Engine).

## Issue Description

The system was inconsistently routing queries to different models instead of using Mistral-Small as the main brain for general queries. Specifically:

1. The NeuralRouter was routing to "mistral" instead of "mistral-small"
2. The AdaptiveRouter was not consistently routing to Mistral-Small
3. The ModelOrchestrator was not properly handling general query types

## Fix Implementation

The fix includes the following changes:

1. **NeuralRouter Update**: Updated the NeuralRouter to consistently use "mistral-small" as the default model
2. **AdaptiveRouter Enhancement**: Improved the AdaptiveRouter to ensure it consistently routes to Mistral-Small
3. **ModelOrchestrator Improvement**: Enhanced the ModelOrchestrator to properly handle general query types

### Key Changes

1. Updated the NeuralRouter default model:
   ```python
   # If no specialized model was selected, use Mistral-Small as the default
   logger.info(f"No specialized model detected, routing to mistral-small")

   # Cache the result
   self.routing_cache[cache_key] = {
       "model": "mistral-small",
       "confidence": 0.7,
       "timestamp": time.time()
   }

   return "mistral-small", 0.7
   ```

2. Enhanced the NeuralRouter to route creative queries to Mistral-Small:
   ```python
   # For write/content queries, use mistral-small
   if query_type in ["write", "content", "creative", "general", "simple", "chat"]:
       logger.info(f"Detected keyword '{query_type}' in query, routing to mistral-small")
       
       # Cache the result
       self.routing_cache[cache_key] = {
           "model": "mistral-small",
           "confidence": 0.8,
           "timestamp": time.time()
       }
       
       return "mistral-small", 0.8
   ```

3. Updated the AdaptiveRouter to default to Mistral-Small for unknown models:
   ```python
   # Unknown model, ignore
   logger.warning(f"Unknown model {neural_model} suggested by neural router, ignoring")
   neural_model = "mistral-small"  # Default to mistral-small for unknown models
   ```

4. Enhanced the ModelOrchestrator to route general queries to Mistral-Small:
   ```python
   # Special case for Gemini or general queries - redirect to Mistral Small
   if query_type == "gemini" or query_type == "general" or query_type == "simple" or query_type == "chat":
       self.logger.info(f"Redirecting {query_type} query type to Mistral Small")
       return await self._call_mistral(input_text, context_str)
   ```

5. Added additional model mappings in the ModelOrchestrator:
   ```python
   self.free_models['general'] = MODEL_IDS['main_brain']  # Use Mistral-Small for general queries
   self.free_models['simple'] = MODEL_IDS['main_brain']   # Use Mistral-Small for simple queries
   self.free_models['chat'] = MODEL_IDS['main_brain']     # Use Mistral-Small for chat queries
   ```

## Testing

The fix was tested using the following test script:

1. `scripts/test_model_routing_fix.py` - Integration test for the model routing system

The test confirmed that:
- The AdaptiveRouter consistently routes to Mistral-Small for general queries
- The NeuralRouter routes to Mistral-Small for general and creative queries
- The ModelOrchestrator properly handles all query types

## Future Improvements

While the current fix ensures that the system consistently uses Mistral-Small as the main brain, the following improvements could be made in the future:

1. **Enhanced Telemetry**: Add more detailed telemetry for routing decisions
2. **Improved Fallback Mechanisms**: Implement more sophisticated fallback mechanisms for offline operation
3. **Dynamic Routing**: Implement dynamic routing based on system load and performance
4. **Routing Explanation**: Add a feature to explain why a query was routed to a specific model

## Conclusion

The model routing issue has been fixed, and the system now consistently uses Mistral-Small as the main brain for general queries. This ensures that users get consistent, high-quality responses for all query types.
