# AI Bug Bounty Hunter

## Overview

The AI Bug Bounty Hunter is an advanced feature that uses AI to scan code for potential bugs, performance issues, and security vulnerabilities. It combines DeepSeek's code understanding capabilities with Claude's natural language generation to provide both technical analysis and humorous feedback.

## Implementation Status
üîÑ **IN PROGRESS** - Expected completion: July 2025

## How It Works

1. The system scans code files or repositories for potential issues
2. DeepSeek analyzes the code for bugs, anti-patterns, and security vulnerabilities
3. Issues are classified by severity and type
4. Claude generates humorous but helpful comments about the detected issues
5. Fix suggestions are provided for common problems

## Planned Features

### Core Capabilities

- **Static Code Analysis** - Scan code for potential bugs, performance issues, and security vulnerabilities
- **Pre-commit Hooks** - Integrate with git to scan code before commits
- **Snarky Feedback** - Generate humorous comments about detected issues
- **Fix Suggestions** - Provide AI-generated code fixes for common problems

### Analysis Types

- **Syntax Errors** - Identify syntax errors and typos
- **Logic Bugs** - Detect logical errors and edge cases
- **Security Vulnerabilities** - Find security issues like SQL injection, XSS, etc.
- **Performance Issues** - Identify inefficient code and performance bottlenecks
- **Code Style** - Check for adherence to coding standards
- **Anti-patterns** - Detect common anti-patterns and bad practices

### Integration Options

- **GitHub Actions** - Run as part of CI/CD pipeline
- **Pre-commit Hooks** - Run before committing code
- **Command Line Interface** - Run on demand from the command line
- **Agent Interface** - Run through the General Pulse agent

## Usage (Planned)

### Through the Agent Interface

```
scan file: path/to/file.py for bugs
analyze repository: username/repo for security issues
check my code in file: path/to/file.js
```

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Scan a single file
python bug_bounty_hunter.py --file path/to/file.py

# Scan a repository
python bug_bounty_hunter.py --repo username/repo

# Scan with specific focus
python bug_bounty_hunter.py --file path/to/file.py --focus security
```

### Pre-commit Hook

```bash
# In .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: bug-bounty-hunter
        name: AI Bug Bounty Hunter
        entry: python scripts/bug_bounty_hunter.py
        language: system
        files: \\.py$
```

## Example Output (Prototype)

### Input: Python File with Issues

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total / len(numbers)  # Potential division by zero

def connect_to_database(username, password):
    conn_str = f"user={username};password={password};server=localhost"  # Security issue: credentials in code
    # No connection error handling
    return connect(conn_str)

def process_data(data):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(data)):  # Inefficient loop
        result.append(data[i] * 2)
    return result
```

### Output: Analysis Report

```
üêõ AI Bug Bounty Hunter Report üêõ

Found 4 issues in your code (1 critical, 2 moderate, 1 style)

üî¥ CRITICAL: Potential division by zero in calculate_average()
   Line 5: return total / len(numbers)
   
   Your function assumes numbers is never empty. Bold move, Cotton!
   Let's see if it pays off when someone inevitably passes an empty list.
   
   Suggested fix:
   ```python
   def calculate_average(numbers):
       if not numbers:
           return 0  # or raise ValueError("Cannot calculate average of empty list")
       total = 0
       for num in numbers:
           total += num
       return total / len(numbers)
   ```

üü† MODERATE: Hardcoded credentials in connect_to_database()
   Line 8: conn_str = f"user={username};password={password};server=localhost"
   
   Storing credentials in code? That's like hiding your house key under the doormat
   and telling everyone on social media about it.
   
   Suggested fix: Use environment variables or a secure configuration file.

üü† MODERATE: Missing error handling in connect_to_database()
   Line 10: return connect(conn_str)
   
   Your function assumes the database connection always succeeds.
   That's some impressive optimism you've got there!
   
   Suggested fix: Add try/except block to handle connection errors.

üü° STYLE: Inefficient loop in process_data()
   Line 14-15: Using range(len(data)) with indexing
   
   This isn't just inefficient, it's Python heresy! List comprehensions
   exist for a reason, my friend.
   
   Suggested fix:
   ```python
   def process_data(data):
       return [item * 2 for item in data]
   ```

Summary: Your code works... until it doesn't. Let's fix these issues before
they come back to haunt you at 3 AM during a production outage.
```

## Implementation Details

### Components

1. **Code Scanner**
   - Parses code files into AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
   - Identifies potential issues based on patterns
   - Classifies issues by severity and type

2. **AI Analysis**
   - Uses DeepSeek to analyze code for complex issues
   - Generates detailed technical explanations
   - Provides fix suggestions

3. **Feedback Generator**
   - Uses Claude to generate humorous but helpful feedback
   - Balances humor with actionable advice
   - Customizable tone and style

4. **Integration Layer**
   - Connects with git hooks
   - Provides CLI interface
   - Integrates with General Pulse agent

### AI Prompt Design

The system uses carefully designed prompts for both DeepSeek and Claude:

1. **DeepSeek Prompt (Technical Analysis)**
   ```
   Analyze the following code for bugs, security issues, and performance problems.
   For each issue, provide:
   1. Issue type (bug, security, performance, style)
   2. Severity (critical, moderate, minor)
   3. Line number and code snippet
   4. Technical explanation
   5. Suggested fix

   Code to analyze:
   [CODE]
   ```

2. **Claude Prompt (Feedback Generation)**
   ```
   You are an experienced but slightly snarky code reviewer.
   Based on the technical analysis below, generate helpful but humorous feedback.
   Be constructive and educational while adding personality to your comments.
   
   Technical analysis:
   [ANALYSIS]
   ```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Language Support** - Extend analysis to multiple programming languages
2. **Custom Rulesets** - Define custom rules for project-specific checks
3. **Learning from Codebase** - Adapt analysis based on project patterns
4. **Security Vulnerability Database** - Connect to CVE and other vulnerability databases
5. **Team Notifications** - Alert team members about critical issues
6. **Fix Application** - Automatically apply suggested fixes with approval
7. **Historical Analysis** - Track code quality over time
