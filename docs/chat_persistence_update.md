# Chat Persistence and Identity Update

This document describes the updates made to P.U.L.S.E.'s chat persistence and identity system.

## Overview

The following improvements have been implemented:

1. **Personalized P.U.L.S.E. Identity**: Updated system prompt to ensure P.U.L.S.E. identifies as a unique, J.A.R.V.I.S.-inspired AI agent with a personalized identity tailored to Uminda's interests, rather than identifying as "Mistral Small".

2. **Session Tracking**: Implemented session tracking to avoid repetitive greetings in consecutive responses, making conversations feel more natural.

3. **Enhanced Chat Persistence**: Improved how P.U.L.S.E. leverages past interactions by enhancing the vector database retrieval and ensuring the context is properly passed to the model.

4. **LanceDB Stability**: Confirmed LanceDB version 0.3.0 is pinned for stability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Mistral-Small System Prompt

Added a dedicated system prompt for Mistral-Small in `utils/prompts.py` that:
- Defines P.U.L.S.E. as a personalized AI assistant inspired by J.A.R.V.I.S.
- Explicitly instructs the model to NEVER identify as Mistral-Small
- Includes personality traits tailored to Uminda's interests (coding, freelancing, anime, Sri Lankan culture)
- Encourages the use of anime references and Sri Lankan cultural elements

### 2. Implemented Session Tracking

Added session tracking in `utils/context_manager.py`:
- Added `session_timeout` (5 minutes) to determine when a new session starts
- Added `is_new_session()` method to check if the current interaction is part of a new session
- Updated the `update()` method to track session state and include it in metadata

### 3. Modified Personality Engine

Updated `utils/personality_engine.py` to use session information:
- Modified `format_response()` to accept an `is_new_session` parameter
- Only add greetings if it's a new session or randomly with low probability
- Enabled anime references for all models, not just Gemini

### 4. Enhanced Vector Database Retrieval

Improved `utils/vector_db.py` to provide better context awareness:
- Enhanced `get_historical_context()` to include more information about past interactions
- Added timestamps and relevance scores to provide better context
- Increased the default number of results from 3 to 5
- Improved formatting of the context for better readability

## Usage

The changes are transparent to users and require no additional configuration. The system will:

1. Automatically detect when a new session starts (after 5 minutes of inactivity)
2. Only include greetings at the start of a new session or occasionally with low probability
3. Provide more relevant historical context for queries
4. Consistently identify as P.U.L.S.E. rather than Mistral-Small

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements include:

1. **Adaptive Session Timeout**: Adjust the session timeout based on user interaction patterns
2. **Personalized Greeting Styles**: Learn user preferences for greeting styles
3. **Context Relevance Filtering**: Improve the filtering of historical context based on relevance
4. **Memory Summarization**: Summarize long-term memory for more efficient context retrieval

## Testing

To test the changes:

1. **Session Tracking**: Try interacting with P.U.L.S.E., then wait 5+ minutes and interact again. The first response after the break should include a greeting.

2. **Identity**: Verify that P.U.L.S.E. never identifies as "Mistral Small" in responses.

3. **Context Awareness**: Ask a question, then ask a follow-up question. P.U.L.S.E. should maintain context between questions.

4. **Vector Retrieval**: Ask about a topic you've discussed before. P.U.L.S.E. should reference past interactions with timestamps and relevance scores.
