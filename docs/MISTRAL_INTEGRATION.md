# Mistral-Small Integration in P.U.L.S.E.

This document provides comprehensive information about the Mistral-Small integration in P.U.L.S.E. (Prime Uminda's Learning System Engine), including the migration from Gemini to Mistral-Small.

## Overview

P.U.L.S.E. now uses Mistral-Small (via OpenRouter) as its main brain, replacing the previous Gemini model. This migration was completed to improve performance, reliability, and to better align with the project's goals.

## Model Details

- **Model ID**: `mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:free`
- **Provider**: OpenRouter
- **Parameters**: 24 billion
- **Strengths**: Strong reasoning, instruction following, and general knowledge
- **Use Cases**: Main brain for orchestration, chat, and general queries

## Model Comparison

| ----------------- | --------- | ------------- |
| Parameters        | Unknown   | 24B           |
| Provider          | Google    | OpenRouter    |
| Context Window    | Limited   | Larger        |
| Specialized Tasks | General   | General       |
| API               | Direct    | OpenRouter    |
| Cost              | Free tier | Free tier     |

## Integration Architecture

Mistral-Small is integrated into P.U.L.S.E. through the following components:

1. **Model Orchestrator**: Manages API calls to Mistral-Small via OpenRouter
2. **Neural Router**: Routes queries to Mistral-Small or specialized models based on intent
3. **Natural Intent Handler**: Uses Mistral-Small for intent classification when online
4. **CLI UI**: Provides testing capabilities for the Mistral-Small API key

## Testing

### Testing the API Key

You can test the Mistral-Small API key using the CLI UI:

```bash
python pulse.py
# Then in the CLI:
test main_brain_api_key
```

This will:

1. Verify that your OpenRouter API key is valid
2. Test Mistral-Small with a simple query
3. Display the response

### Testing with a Custom Script

A dedicated test script is available in the `docs/tests` directory:

```bash
python docs/tests/test_main_brain.py
```

This script tests:

1. OpenRouter API key validation
2. Mistral-Small model response
3. Error handling and timeouts

## Configuration

Mistral-Small is configured in the `configs/models.yaml` file with the following settings:

```yaml
main_brain:
  model_id: mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:free
  provider: openrouter
  max_tokens: 4096
  temperature: 0.7
```

## Best Practices

1. **API Key Management**: Store your OpenRouter API key in the `.env` file
2. **Error Handling**: The system includes retry logic and exponential backoff for API failures
3. **Timeout Management**: API calls have a 30-second timeout to prevent hanging
4. **Fallback Strategy**: If Mistral-Small is unavailable, the system falls back to other models

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Invalid**: Ensure your OpenRouter API key is correctly set in the `.env` file
2. **Rate Limiting**: OpenRouter has rate limits; the system includes retry logic for these cases
3. **Timeout Errors**: Check your internet connection if you experience timeout errors
4. **Model Unavailable**: OpenRouter occasionally performs maintenance; the system will fall back to other models

### Logs

Check the logs for detailed information about API calls and errors:

```

```

## Implementation Details

The Mistral-Small integration includes:

1. **Updated Neural Router**: Routes queries to Mistral-Small instead of Gemini
2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved retry logic and error reporting
3. **Specialized Testing**: Dedicated methods for testing the Mistral-Small integration
4. **Consistent Naming**: Updated all references from Gemini to Mistral-Small

## Migration Details

### Key Changes

1. **Main Brain Replacement**: Replaced Gemini with Mistral-Small (24B parameters) via OpenRouter
2. **Neural Router Updates**: Updated the neural router to use Mistral-Small for routing decisions
3. **Intent Classification**: Modified the natural intent handler to use Mistral-Small for classification
4. **Testing Infrastructure**: Enhanced testing capabilities for the main brain
5. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling with retry logic and better error reporting
6. **Documentation**: Updated documentation to reflect the new architecture

### Files Modified

- `utils/cli_ui.py`: Updated the `test_main_brain_api_key` method
- `utils/neural_router.py`: Changed routing logic to use Mistral-Small
- `utils/natural_intent_handler.py`: Renamed and updated classification methods
- `skills/model_orchestrator.py`: Enhanced the `test_main_brain` method
- Documentation files: Updated to reflect the new architecture

### Implementation Details

#### Neural Router Updates

The neural router was updated to use Mistral-Small for routing decisions:

```python
# Before
model_id = MODEL_IDS["main_brain"]  # Gemini
response = await self.model_interface.call_openrouter(...)

# After
model_id = MODEL_IDS["mistral"]  # Mistral-Small
response = await self.model_interface.call_openrouter(...)
```

#### Intent Classification Updates

The natural intent handler was updated to use Mistral-Small for classification:

```python
# Before
async def _classify_with_gemini(self, text: str) -> Optional[str]:
    # ...
    response = await self.model_interface.call_gemini(...)

# After
async def _classify_with_mistral(self, text: str) -> Optional[str]:
    # ...
    response = await self.model_interface.call_openrouter(
        model_id="mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:free",
        query=prompt,
        max_tokens=50
    )
```

## Migration Benefits

1. **Improved Performance**: Mistral-Small provides better reasoning capabilities
2. **Enhanced Reliability**: OpenRouter provides more reliable access to the model
3. **Better Error Handling**: Improved retry logic and error reporting
4. **Consistent Architecture**: All models now use OpenRouter, simplifying the codebase
5. **Future-Proofing**: Easier to upgrade to newer models as they become available

## Known Issues and Limitations

1. **API Rate Limits**: OpenRouter has rate limits that may affect heavy usage
2. **Offline Mode**: Mistral-Small requires internet access; offline mode still uses Phi
3. **Memory Usage**: The system still requires optimization for low-memory environments

## Future Improvements

1. **Streaming Responses**: Implement streaming for real-time responses
2. **Context Window Optimization**: Better utilize Mistral-Small's context window
3. **Fine-Tuning**: Explore fine-tuning options for specialized tasks
4. **Caching**: Implement response caching for common queries
