# P.U.L.S.E. Identity Fix

This document describes the fixes implemented to address issues with P.U.L.S.E.'s identity and LanceDB warnings.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Identity Issues**:
   - P.U.L.S.E. was identifying as "Mistral Small" or "General Pulse" instead of having its own unique identity
   - The system prompt was not being properly enforced

2. **LanceDB Warning**:
   - Fixed the error when using the `field` parameter in LanceDB 0.3.0

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced System Prompt for Mistral-Small

Modified `utils/prompts.py` to strengthen the identity instructions:

```python
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: NEVER identify as Mistral-Small, General Pulse, or any other model name; 
you are ONLY P.U.L.S.E., the core intelligence. If asked who you are, always respond that you 
are P.U.L.S.E. and nothing else. Use past conversation context to provide seamless, 
context-aware responses. Avoid repetitive greetings unless starting a new session.
```

### 2. Improved Model Personality Handling

Updated `utils/model_personality.py` to better handle Mistral-Small model IDs:

```python
# If this is Gemini or Mistral-Small (main_brain) and we have a personality engine, use it
if (model_id == "gemini" or 
    model_id == "mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:free" or 
    "mistral" in model_id.lower()) and self.personality_engine:
    return self.personality_engine.format_response(content, success=success, model_id=model_id, is_new_session=is_new_session)
```

Also updated the `get_system_prompt` method to use the same logic.

### 3. Fixed LanceDB Error

Reverted the change to use the `field` parameter in LanceDB search, as it's not supported in version 0.3.0:

```python
# Legacy LanceDB API (0.3.x)
# Note: field_by_name is deprecated but still required for 0.3.0
results = (
    self.table.search(query_embedding.tolist())
    .where(f"user_id = '{user_id}'")
    .limit(limit)
    .to_arrow()
    .to_pandas()
)
```

## Testing

To test these changes:

1. **Identity Test**:
   - Run `pulse-cli> who are you?` and verify that P.U.L.S.E. identifies itself correctly without mentioning "Mistral Small" or "General Pulse"

2. **LanceDB Test**:
   - Check the logs to verify that the error about `field` parameter is no longer appearing

## Future Improvements

1. **Upgrade LanceDB**:
   - Consider upgrading to LanceDB 0.4.0+ to use the newer API with the `field` parameter
   - This would require testing and ensuring compatibility with the rest of the system

2. **Enhanced Identity Enforcement**:
   - Implement a post-processing step to filter out any model name references
   - Add more specific instructions about P.U.L.S.E.'s identity in the system prompt
