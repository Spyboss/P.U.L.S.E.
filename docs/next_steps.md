# Next Steps for General Pulse

This document outlines the changes made to enhance the keyword-based intent classifier and the next steps for further improvements.

## Recent Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced Keyword Classifier

- **Expanded Keyword Set**: Added more keywords for each intent to improve classification accuracy.
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Implemented fuzzy string matching to handle typos and minor variations in user input.
- **Typo Correction**: Added common typo corrections for frequently mistyped keywords.
- **Improved Stopword Handling**: Enhanced stopword removal to focus on meaningful words.

### 2. Refined Command Parser

- **Enhanced Regex Patterns**: Improved regex patterns to handle more complex command formats.
- **Context Awareness**: Added context tracking to remember previous interactions and provide relevant suggestions.
- **Edge Case Handling**: Better handling of edge cases like future time queries and alternative AI query formats.
- **Suggestion System**: Implemented a suggestion system that offers relevant follow-up actions based on context.

### 3. Data Collection and Analysis

- **Training Data Extraction**: Created scripts to extract and generate training data from existing interactions.
- **Keyword Analysis**: Implemented analysis of labeled data to identify the most effective keywords for each intent.
- **Testing Framework**: Added comprehensive testing for the classifier with detailed accuracy reporting.

### 4. Machine Learning Preparation

- **DistilBERT Viability Check**: Added a system to check if DistilBERT training is viable based on available resources.
- **Training Script Generation**: Created a script for training a 4-bit quantized DistilBERT model when sufficient data is available.
- **Documentation**: Added detailed documentation for the planned ML-based intent classification system.

## Maintaining the Enhanced System

### Keyword Classifier

The enhanced keyword classifier is located in `utils/keyword_intent_handler.py`. To maintain it:

1. **Add New Keywords**: When you notice misclassifications, add relevant keywords to the appropriate intent in `models/keyword_classifier/keywords.json`.
2. **Add Common Typos**: If you notice common typos, add them to the `typo_corrections` dictionary in the `KeywordIntentHandler` class.
3. **Adjust Fuzzy Threshold**: If fuzzy matching is too aggressive or not aggressive enough, adjust the `fuzzy_threshold` parameter (default: 80).

### Command Parser

The enhanced command parser is located in `utils/command_parser.py`. To maintain it:

1. **Add New Patterns**: When adding new command types, add appropriate regex patterns to the `patterns` dictionary.
2. **Enhance Context Awareness**: Modify the `_get_suggestions` method to add more context-aware suggestions.
3. **Add Edge Case Handling**: If you notice edge cases that aren't handled well, add specific handling in the `parse` method.

### Testing

Run the classifier test script regularly to monitor accuracy:

```bash
python scripts/test_classifier.py
```

This will generate a detailed report in `logs/classifier_test.log` and `logs/classifier_results.json`.

## Next Steps for Further Improvement

### Short-term Improvements

1. **Expand Training Data**: Continue collecting user interactions to build a larger training dataset.
2. **Refine Regex Patterns**: Add more specific patterns for complex commands.
3. **Enhance Context Awareness**: Improve the suggestion system to be more helpful and context-aware.
4. **Add More Typo Corrections**: Monitor logs for common typos and add corrections.

### Medium-term Improvements

1. **Implement DistilBERT**: When sufficient data is available, train and integrate the DistilBERT model.
2. **Hybrid Classification**: Implement a hybrid approach that combines keyword-based and ML-based classification.
3. **User Feedback Loop**: Add a mechanism for users to correct misclassifications to improve the system.
4. **Intent Confidence Scoring**: Add confidence scores to classifications to better handle ambiguous inputs.

### Long-term Vision

1. **Multi-intent Recognition**: Enhance the system to recognize multiple intents in a single command.
2. **Conversational Context**: Maintain conversation state across multiple interactions for more natural dialogue.
3. **Personalized Classification**: Adapt classification based on user preferences and history.
4. **Continuous Learning**: Implement a system that continuously improves from user interactions.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Log Analysis**: Regularly review logs to identify misclassifications and areas for improvement.
2. **Performance Metrics**: Track classification accuracy over time to ensure the system is improving.
3. **Resource Usage**: Monitor memory and CPU usage to ensure the system remains efficient.
4. **User Feedback**: Collect and analyze user feedback to identify pain points and areas for improvement.

## Conclusion

The enhanced keyword-based intent classifier provides a solid foundation for General Pulse's natural language understanding capabilities. By following the maintenance guidelines and implementing the suggested improvements, you can continue to enhance the system's accuracy and user experience while preparing for a potential transition to a more sophisticated ML-based approach in the future.
