# Codebase Cleanup

This document describes the cleanup process performed on the General Pulse codebase to improve maintainability, reduce duplication, and ensure consistent implementation.

## Overview

The codebase cleanup focused on:

1. Removing duplicate files
2. Consolidating implementations
3. Updating imports to use the correct files
4. Ensuring consistent naming conventions
5. Improving code organization

## Cleanup Actions

### 1. Model Interface Consolidation

**Action:** Consolidated multiple model interface implementations into a single optimized version.

**Files Affected:**
- Removed: `skills/model_interface.py`
- Removed: `utils/model_interface.py`
- Kept: `skills/optimized_model_interface.py`

**Benefits:**
- Single source of truth for model interface implementation
- Improved memory management and resource optimization
- Consistent error handling across all model interactions
- Better offline mode support

### 2. Intent Classifier Consolidation

**Action:** Consolidated multiple intent classifier implementations into a single DistilBERT-based implementation.

**Files Affected:**
- Removed: `skills/intent_classifier.py`
- Removed: `utils/intent_classifier.py`
- Removed: `utils/intent_classifier_onnx.py`
- Removed: `utils/optimized_intent_classifier.py`
- Kept: `utils/distilbert_classifier.py`

**Benefits:**
- Single implementation for intent classification
- Consistent approach to offline intent handling
- Reduced code duplication
- Improved maintainability

### 3. Ollama Management Consolidation

**Action:** Integrated Ollama client functionality into the Ollama manager.

**Files Affected:**
- Removed: `utils/ollama_client.py`
- Updated: `utils/ollama_manager.py` (integrated client functionality)

**Benefits:**
- Unified Ollama management
- Better resource monitoring
- Improved startup/shutdown logic
- Consistent error handling

### 4. CLI UI Consolidation

**Action:** Removed duplicate CLI UI files.

**Files Affected:**
- Removed: `scripts/cli_ui.py`
- Removed: `scripts/cli_ui_launcher.py`
- Kept: `utils/cli_ui.py`
- Kept: `pulse.py` (main entry point)

**Benefits:**
- Single implementation of CLI UI
- Consistent user experience
- Reduced code duplication

### 5. Memory Manager Verification

**Action:** Verified that the two memory manager implementations serve different purposes.

**Files Affected:**
- Kept: `utils/memory_manager.py` (general memory management)
- Kept: `skills/task_memory_manager.py` (task-specific memory management)

**Benefits:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Specialized memory management for different use cases

## Import Updates

All imports across the codebase were updated to reference the consolidated implementations:

1. Updated imports from `skills.model_interface` to `skills.optimized_model_interface`
2. Updated class references from `ModelInterface` to `OptimizedModelInterface`
3. Updated imports to use the correct Ollama manager
4. Updated imports to use the DistilBERT classifier

## Testing

All changes were made with careful consideration to maintain functionality. The test suite was updated to reflect the new implementations, ensuring that all features continue to work as expected.

## Future Recommendations

1. **Standardize Naming Conventions:** Continue to standardize naming conventions across the codebase
2. **Improve Documentation:** Add more inline documentation to explain complex functionality
3. **Enhance Test Coverage:** Expand test coverage to ensure all consolidated implementations are thoroughly tested
4. **Regular Cleanup:** Perform regular cleanup to prevent future duplication
