# Tasks Directory

This directory contains task tracking files for the General Pulse project.

## Contents

- `tasks.md` - Current task list with status information
- `tasks.md.bak` - Backup of the task list

## Task Format

Tasks are typically organized by status (completed, in-progress, pending) and may include additional information such as priority, assignee, and due date.

Example:

```markdown
## Completed Tasks
- [x] Implement basic GitHub integration
- [x] Add timezone conversion functionality

## In-Progress Tasks
- [ ] Fix timezone conversion bug
- [ ] Implement better error handling for GitHub integration

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Add support for multiple user profiles
- [ ] Implement voice input/output capabilities
```

## Usage

The task list is maintained manually and updated as tasks are completed or new tasks are added. It serves as a simple project management tool for tracking progress.
