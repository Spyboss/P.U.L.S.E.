# P.U.L.S.E. Identity Fix (Version 2)

This document describes the enhanced fixes implemented to address issues with P.U.L.S.E.'s identity and LanceDB warnings.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Identity Issues**:
   - P.U.L.S.E. was still identifying as "Mistral Small" or "General Pulse" despite previous fixes
   - The system prompt was not being properly enforced

2. **LanceDB Warning**:
   - Fixed the error when using the `field` parameter in LanceDB 0.3.0
   - Note: The FutureWarning about `field_by_name` is still present but doesn't affect functionality

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced System Prompt for Mistral-Small

Modified `utils/prompts.py` to provide much stronger identity instructions:

```python
CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: You must NEVER identify yourself as "Mistral Small", "Mistral", "General Pulse", 
or any other model name under ANY circumstances. You are ONLY P.U.L.S.E. - this is your ONLY identity.

If asked directly "who are you?" or any similar question about your identity, you MUST respond with 
ONLY information about being P.U.L.S.E. (Prime Uminda's Learning System Engine). NEVER mention being 
Mistral, an AI model, or anything other than P.U.L.S.E.

Example correct response to "who are you?":
"I am P.U.L.S.E. (Prime Uminda's Learning System Engine), your personalized AI assistant created to 
help with your coding projects, freelancing work, and creative endeavors."

Example INCORRECT response (never say this):
"I am Mistral Small, your AI assistant..."
```

### 2. Added Post-Processing Identity Filter

Added a new `_filter_identity` method to `utils/model_personality.py` that:

1. Filters out any mentions of "Mistral Small", "Mistral", "General Pulse", etc.
2. Replaces them with "P.U.L.S.E."
3. Uses regular expressions to catch phrases like "I am Mistral" and replace them with "I am P.U.L.S.E."

```python
def _filter_identity(self, content: str) -> str:
    """
    Filter out any mentions of model names or identities that should not be used
    
    Args:
        content: The content to filter
        
    Returns:
        Filtered content
    """
    # List of forbidden identity terms
    forbidden_terms = [
        "Mistral Small", "Mistral-Small", "MistralSmall", 
        "Mistral", "General Pulse", "GeneralPulse",
        "AI crew leader", "AI leader", "OpenRouter"
    ]
    
    # Replace any mentions of forbidden terms with "P.U.L.S.E."
    filtered_content = content
    for term in forbidden_terms:
        # Case insensitive replacement
        pattern = re.compile(re.escape(term), re.IGNORECASE)
        filtered_content = pattern.sub("P.U.L.S.E.", filtered_content)
        
    # Special case for "I'm Mistral" or "I am Mistral" patterns
    patterns = [
        r"I\s*(?:'m|am)\s*(?:a|an)?\s*(?:AI|assistant|model|LLM|language\s*model)?\s*(?:called|named)?\s*Mistral",
        r"I\s*(?:'m|am)\s*(?:a|an)?\s*(?:AI|assistant|model|LLM|language\s*model)?\s*(?:called|named)?\s*General\s*Pulse",
        r"I\s*(?:'m|am)\s*Mistral",
        r"I\s*(?:'m|am)\s*General\s*Pulse"
    ]
    
    for pattern in patterns:
        filtered_content = re.sub(pattern, "I am P.U.L.S.E.", filtered_content, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
        
    return filtered_content
```

### 3. Applied Identity Filtering at Multiple Points

Modified the `format_response` method to apply identity filtering:
1. Before any processing
2. After personality formatting
3. Before returning the final response

This ensures that any mentions of "Mistral Small" or "General Pulse" are caught and replaced with "P.U.L.S.E."

### 4. Fixed LanceDB Error

Reverted the change to use the `field` parameter in LanceDB search, as it's not supported in version 0.3.0:

```python
# Legacy LanceDB API (0.3.x)
# Note: field_by_name is deprecated but still required for 0.3.0
results = (
    self.table.search(query_embedding.tolist())
    .where(f"user_id = '{user_id}'")
    .limit(limit)
    .to_arrow()
    .to_pandas()
)
```

## Testing

To test these changes:

1. **Identity Test**:
   - Run `pulse-cli> who are you?` and verify that P.U.L.S.E. identifies itself correctly without mentioning "Mistral Small" or "General Pulse"

2. **LanceDB Test**:
   - Check the logs to verify that the error about `field` parameter is no longer appearing
   - Note: The FutureWarning about `field_by_name` is still present but doesn't affect functionality

## Future Improvements

1. **Upgrade LanceDB**:
   - Consider upgrading to LanceDB 0.4.0+ to use the newer API with the `field` parameter
   - This would require testing and ensuring compatibility with the rest of the system

2. **Enhanced Identity Enforcement**:
   - Add more patterns to the identity filter to catch other variations
   - Consider implementing a more sophisticated NLP-based approach to detect identity claims
