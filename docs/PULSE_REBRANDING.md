# P.U.L.S.E. Rebranding

## Overview

P.U.L.S.E. (Prime Uminda's Learning System Engine) is the new name for what was previously known as "General Pulse". This rebranding reflects the evolution of the project into a more personalized, powerful AI assistant inspired by J.A.R.V.I.S. (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) from Iron Man.

## Meaning of P.U.L.S.E.

The acronym P.U.L.S.E. stands for:

- **P**rime: Indicating the high quality and primary importance of the system
- **U**minda's: Personalized for the creator and primary user
- **L**earning: Highlighting the system's ability to learn and adapt
- **S**ystem: Representing the comprehensive nature of the integrated components
- **E**ngine: Emphasizing the powerful processing capabilities

## Rebranding Changes

The rebranding included the following changes:

1. **Name Change**: From "General Pulse" to "P.U.L.S.E."
2. **Updated CLI Header**:

   ```
   ╭──────────────────────────────────────────╮
   │ Prime Uminda's Learning System Engine    │
   │ ver 2.1 | Memory: 6.1/8GB | CPU: 55%     │
   ╰──────────────────────────────────────────╯
   ```

3. **New Welcome Message**:

   ```
   Good morning Uminda. P.U.L.S.E. systems nominal.
   3 pending tasks. Shall we begin?
   ```

4. **Documentation Updates**: All documentation files updated to reflect the new name and acronym

## Design Philosophy

The rebranding to P.U.L.S.E. aligns with the project's core philosophy:

1. **Personalization**: Creating an AI assistant that adapts to the user's specific needs and preferences
2. **Integration**: Combining multiple specialized AI models into a cohesive system
3. **Efficiency**: Optimizing for performance on limited hardware
4. **Adaptability**: Learning from interactions to improve over time
5. **Reliability**: Providing consistent, dependable assistance

   - `skills/pulse_agent.py`
   - `utils/prompts.py`
   - `utils/neural_router.py`
   - `utils/personality_engine.py`
   - `skills/model_orchestrator.py`
   - `skills/optimized_model_interface.py`

2. **Documentation**:

   - `README.md`
   - `docs/*.md`

3. **Configuration**:
   - `configs/models.py`

## Future Direction

With the P.U.L.S.E. rebranding, the project continues to evolve toward becoming a comprehensive AI assistant that:

- Serves as a loyal companion for coding, freelancing, and personal growth
- Leverages specialized AI models for different tasks
- Maintains a personality that adapts to user needs and preferences
- Optimizes performance on limited hardware
- Provides both online and offline capabilities

The rebranding represents not just a name change, but a renewed commitment to building a truly personal AI assistant that embodies the spirit of J.A.R.V.I.S. while maintaining its own unique identity.
