# P.U.L.S.E. Rebranding

## Overview

P.U.L.S.E. (Prime Uminda's Learning System Engine) is the new name for what was previously known as "General Pulse". This rebranding reflects the evolution of the project into a more personalized, powerful AI assistant inspired by J.A.R.V.I.S. (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) from Iron Man.

## Meaning of P.U.L.S.E.

The acronym P.U.L.S.E. stands for:

- **L**earning: Highlighting the system's ability to learn and adapt
- **S**ystem: Representing the comprehensive nature of the integrated components
- **E**ngine: Emphasizing the powerful processing capabilities

The rebranding represents not just a name change, but a renewed commitment to building a truly personal AI assistant that embodies the spirit of J.A.R.V.I.S. while maintaining its own unique identity.
