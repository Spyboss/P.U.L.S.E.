# P.U.L.S.E. Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for the P.U.L.S.E. (Prime Uminda's Learning System Engine) project. The plan is divided into phases, with each phase focusing on specific improvements to the system.

## Current State Assessment

The P.U.L.S.E. project has several key components that need improvement:

1. **Chat Persistence**: Currently implemented with MongoDB Atlas and SQLite fallback, but needs enhancement
2. **Vector Database**: Using LanceDB with version compatibility issues (0.3.0 vs 0.4.0+)
3. **Context Management**: Needs improvement for better conversation flow
4. **Model Routing**: Mistral-Small should be the main brain, but routing issues exist
5. **Error Handling**: Needs better error handling for integrations and components
