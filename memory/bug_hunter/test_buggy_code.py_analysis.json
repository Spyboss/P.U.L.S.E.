      "description": "No check for division by zero in the `divide_numbers` function, which will raise a ZeroDivisionError if b is 0.",
      "severity": "critical",
      "fix_suggestion": "Add a check to ensure b is not zero before performing the division. For example: `if b == 0: raise ValueError('Cannot divide by zero')`."

      "line": 8,
      "description": "No check for index out of bounds in the `get_item_from_list` function, which will raise an IndexError if the index is out of range.",
      "severity": "critical",
      "fix_suggestion": "Add a check to ensure the index is within the bounds of the list. For example: `if index >= len(my_list): raise IndexError('Index out of bounds')`."

      "line": 12,
      "description": "No error handling for file not found in the `read_file_content` function, which will raise a FileNotFoundError if the file does not exist.",
      "severity": "high",
      "fix_suggestion": "Wrap the file reading operation in a try-except block to handle FileNotFoundError. For example: `try: with open(file_path, 'r') as file: return file.read() except FileNotFoundError: return 'File not found'`."

      "description": "Unused import of the `random` module, which is unnecessary and clutters the code.",
      "severity": "low",
      "fix_suggestion": "Remove the unused import statement."

      "description": "SQL Injection vulnerability in the `get_user` function due to direct string concatenation in the SQL query.",
      "severity": "critical",
      "fix_suggestion": "Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. For example: `query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s'` and pass the username as a parameter."

    {
      "line": 24,
      "description": "Potential infinite loop in the `process_data` function if the processing of items removes elements from the list, as the index `i` is not incremented.",
      "severity": "high",
      "fix_suggestion": "Ensure that `i` is incremented in each iteration of the loop. For example: `i += 1` after `process_item(data[i])`."

      "line": 31,
      "description": "Potential memory leak in the `create_large_list` function as the large list is created but never released.",
      "severity": "medium",
      "fix_suggestion": "Ensure that the large list is properly managed or released after use. Consider using a generator or clearing the list after processing."

      "description": "Race condition in the `increment_counter` function due to unsynchronized access to the shared variable `shared_counter`.",
      "severity": "high",
      "fix_suggestion": "Use synchronization mechanisms like threading.Lock to ensure thread-safe access to the shared variable."
