# Legacy MVP Implementation

This directory contains the original MVP implementation of General Pulse before the major remodel.

These files are kept for reference purposes but are not used in the current implementation.

## Structure

- `main.py` - Original entry point
- `skills/agent.py` - Original agent implementation
- `utils/agent_personality.py` - Original personality implementation

## Current Implementation

The current implementation uses:
- `pulse.py` - New entry point
- `skills/pulse_agent.py` - New agent implementation
- `utils/personality_engine.py` - New personality engine

Please use the new implementation files for all development and updates.
